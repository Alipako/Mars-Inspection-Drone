# Project MID
Title: Autonomous Navigation for a Martian Inspection Drone
## Overview: 
This GitHub repository hosts the culmination of research efforts aimed at creating a comprehensive operational system for simulating Martian aerial missions, particularly focusing on the exploration of lava tubes. The system integrates various components, including a virtual environment (Gazebo), a drone model (ArduPilot), a neural network (YOLOv3), and navigation algorithms (C++), all tailored specifically for the challenges of Martian terrain exploration.
